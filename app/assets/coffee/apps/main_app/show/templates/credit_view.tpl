<p><strong>MENAM Art Map</strong> is an interactive visualization of the institutional connections, life trajectories and centers of prominent members of the Middle Eastern art scene exhibiting in the west. The geo-spatial network representation is based on information extracted from a large corpus of artist biographies. </p>
<p>Each individual biography is a self-representation shaped by the artist’s personal emphasis, but also by the embedded values, expectations and institutional politics of the art world. A biography is a portrait that highlights certain aspects and omits others. By itself, a single biography is of limited value for understanding how artists of Middle Eastern origin enter in international art scene, or how the notion of Middle Eastern art is constructed through the international art institutions. But if several hundred biographies are aggregated and analyzed as a text corpus, common features and patterns start to emerge. By identifying dates, locations, personal trajectories, and institutions such as museums, galleries, festivals and academies, we hope not only to investigate the relationship on the MENAM art scene compared to the international art world, but also to reveal characteristics of the institutional context these artists are embedded in.</p>
<p>MENAM Art Map is an experiment in what literary scholar Franco Moretti calls “Distant Reading” using computational means such as natural language processing and advances in multi-dimensional networks. It represents the first stage of a research project dedicated to the analysis of text-networks at the Center for Texts, Maps and Networks at Northeastern University, Boston.</p>
